You job will be to research webcomics.

For our purposes a webcomic will be defined as "periodic original web content that is centered
around a graphic. It is usually humorous, but may tell a continuing story"

First, we'll need a list of the most popular webcomics. Here's some starting examples:
http://questionablecontent.net/ 
https://xkcd.com/

Please generate a list of the top 100 most popular webcomics, their name and url. 

terminology: a panel is a rectangular sub-section of the graphic. Some examples:
https://xkcd.com/3194/ has 1 panel 
https://xkcd.com/3192/ has 4 panels 
https://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=5743 has 6 panels

Next, you'll analyze the top 10 webcomics. To get averages, analyze 10 entries for each webcomic.
Some data points to gather for each are are:

- how often is a new comic published (daily, weekdays, semi-weekly, weekly, etc.)

- On average, how many panels are in the typical entry? 

- Where does the text for the comic appear? in the graphic, outside the graphic, above or below it, or both?

- On average, how many words are in the typical entry?

- are the graphics color or black-and-white? 

- what is the average reading level for the comic? 

- how long as the webcomic been published? 

- who is the author of the webcomic?

- how does the comic make money? Are there ads on the site? does the site sell merchandise? Are there affiliate links? is there a patreon link? 

Output the findings in both markdown and json formats.
